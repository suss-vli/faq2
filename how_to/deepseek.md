## What is DeepSeek R1
DeepSeek R1 is an advanced reasoning AI model developed by the Chinese company DeepSeek, designed to excel at complex problem-solving and logical tasks by breaking down issues into multiple steps; it is considered a competitor to OpenAI's models and is notable for being open-source, allowing for free commercial and academic use, while also boasting a lower operating cost compared to other high-performance AI models. 

Key points about DeepSeek R1:
- **Focus on reasoning:** Unlike many other AI models that prioritize generating text, DeepSeek R1 prioritizes logical reasoning and step-by-step problem-solving. 
- **Open-source access:** The model is available to the public under an MIT license, allowing researchers and developers to freely access and customize it. 
- **Cost-effective:** Compared to other high-performance AI models, DeepSeek R1 is designed to operate at a significantly lower cost. 
- **Reinforcement learning based:** The model leverages reinforcement learning techniques to improve its reasoning capabilities. 
- **Potential applications:** Complex problem-solving, logical inference tasks, research projects requiring advanced reasoning abilities. 

## Running DeepSeek Locally
To run DeepSeek R1 locally, follow any of these options:
1. **Running Model Locally using Ollama**
    - Guide by CodeAcademy: [How to Run Deepseek R1 Locally](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-run-deepseek-r-1-locally)
    - Guide by WorkOS: [How to run DeepSeek locally](https://workos.com/blog/how-to-run-deepseek-r1-locally)

  **Choosing a Distilled Model**: The DeepSeek-R1-Distill variants are smaller (1.5B, 7B, 8B, etc.) and optimized for developers/students/lecturers who: 
  - Want lighter compute requirements, so they can run models on less-powerful machines. 
  - Prefer faster responses, especially for real-time coding help. 
  - Don’t want to sacrifice too much performance or reasoning capability.
  
  To install a distilled model (e.g. 1.5b), just specify its tag, as such: 
  `ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b`
